    <h3> MGP </h3>
    
    <p>This is my  model of practice and it shows how well the navigation bar was created and it inspired how I was able to make own navigation bar with the hover colours, this website is a good model of practice because of the style is more responsive and when the page is made small, all the content more with it and the navigation bar fall into a menu tab so the user will have to click on the menu lines to bring out the navigation. The colours of the website are used all through the website and it has a very professional look and feel. </p>

      </div>

   
    <p>The website is well put together and it the web site makes sure that all the text and images are all inline, the website itself is very clean and all the functionality of the website is very well coded and this I was this page was the inspiration for my website.</p>

      <p>I was able to makes changes to make change overtime by looking at the way this website and the way that it has been made and I took time to research many thing that the developer has implemented into their website and put the same feature into mine like the navigation hover feature. </p>
